  abstract = {Data documentation in psychology lags behind not only many other disciplines, but also basic standards of usefulness. Psychological scientists often prefer to invest the time and effort that would be necessary to document existing data well in other duties, such as writing and collecting more data. Codebooks therefore tend to be unstandardized and stored in proprietary formats, and they are rarely properly indexed in search engines. This means that rich data sets are sometimes used only once—by their creators—and left to disappear into oblivion. Even if they can find an existing data set, researchers are unlikely to publish analyses based on it if they cannot be confident that they understand it well enough. My codebook package makes it easier to generate rich metadata in human- and machine-readable codebooks. It uses metadata from existing sources and automates some tedious tasks, such as documenting psychological scales and reliabilities, summarizing descriptive statistics, and identifying patterns of missingness. The codebook R package and Web app make it possible to generate a rich codebook in a few minutes and just three clicks. Over time, its use could lead to psychological data becoming findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable, thereby reducing research waste and benefiting both its users and the scientific community as a whole.},

  abstract = {For more than a century, scientists have been collecting behavioral data--an increasing fraction of which is now being publicly shared so other researchers can reuse them to replicate, integrate or extend past results. Although behavioral data is fundamental to many scientific fields, there is currently no widely adopted standard for formatting, naming, organizing, describing or sharing such data. This lack of standardization is a major bottleneck for scientific progress. Not only does it prevent the effective reuse of data, it also affects how behavioral data in general are processed, as non-standard data calls for custom-made data analysis code and prevents the development of efficient tools. To address this problem, we develop the Behaverse Data Model (BDM), a standard for structuring behavioral data. Here we focus on major concepts in behavioral data, leaving further details and developments to the project's website (https://behaverse.github.io/data-model/).},

  abstract = {Ex-post harmonization of survey data creates new opportunities for research by extending the geographical and/or time coverage of analyses. Researchers increasingly combine data from different survey projects to analyze them as a single dataset, and while teams engaged in data harmonization continue to expand the information they provide to end users, there are still no commonly agreed standards for the documentation of data processing. Existing harmonization project typically opt for recode scripts that are generally hard to read, modify, and reuse, although some projects make efforts to facilitate verification and reproduction. This paper describes an alternative procedure and a set of simple tools for the exploration, recoding, and documentation of harmonization of survey data, relying on crosswalks. The presented tools are flexible and software-agnostic. The illustrative example uses the programming language R and spreadsheets—both common software choices among social scientists. Harmonization of variables on trust in institutions from four major cross-national survey projects serves as an illustration of the proposed workflow and of opportunities harmonization creates.},

The insights gained can not only help psychologists do their research better but also provide useful insights into the basics of social interaction and cognition. This chapter reviews some of the many recent advances in the literature, including the following: New findings challenge a long-standing prejudice against studies with low response rates; innovative techniques for pretesting questionnaires offer opportunities for improving measurement validity; surprising effects of the verbal labels put on rating scale points have been identified, suggesting optimal approaches to scale labeling; respondents interpret questions on the basis of the norms of everyday conversation, so violations of those conventions introduce error; some measurement error thought to have been attributable to social desirability response bias now appears to be due to other factors instead, thus encouraging different approaches to fixing such problems; and a new theory of satisficing in questionnaire responding offers parsimonious explanations for a range of response patterns long recognized by psycholo-gists and survey researchers but previously not well understood.},

  abstract = {While the choice of matrix versus item-by-item questions has received considerable attention in the literature, it is still unclear in what situation one is better than the other. Building upon the previous findings, this study expands this line of research by examining whether the difference between the two question types is moderated by the number of response options. Through a web survey experiment, this study compares matrix and item-by-item questions with 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 11 response options. Additionally, we also investigate the impact of the device used to complete the survey on data quality. The results show that straight lining and response time are similar between the two question types across all response lengths, but item nonresponse tends to be higher for matrix than item-by-item question, especially among mobile respondents. Also measurement models reveal measurement equivalence between the two question types when there are fewer than seven response options. For matrices with 9 or 11 response options, analyses reveal substantial differences compared to item-by-item questions.},

  abstract = {When "metadata" became breaking news, appearing in stories about surveillance by the National Security Agency, many members of the public encountered this once-obscure term from information science for the first time. Should people be reassured that the NSA was "only" collecting metadata about phone calls - information about the caller, the recipient, the time, the duration, the location - and not recordings of the conversations themselves? Or does phone call metadata reveal more than it seems? In this book, the author offers an introduction to metadata. In the age of ubiquitous computing, metadata has become infrastructural, like the electrical grid or the highway system. We interact with it or generate it every day. It is not, the author explains, just "data about data." It is a means by which the complexity of an object is represented in a simpler form. When metadata does its job well, it fades into the background; people may take it for granted. The author not only explains what metadata is, he also explores why it exists. He distinguishes among different types of metadata - descriptive, administrative, structural, preservation, and use - and examines different users and uses of each type. He discusses the technologies that make modern metadata possible, and he speculates about metadata's future. By the end of the book, readers will see metadata everywhere. Because, the author argues, it's metadata's world, and we are just living in it.--adapted from publisher's description},

The authors consider effects on survey answers, item nonresponse, interview length, and the respondents' evaluation of several aspects of the survey (such as layout). Four different formats are used, with one, four, ten, and forty items and headers on a screen. The authors find no effect of format on the arousal index, but nonresponse increases with the number of items appearing on a single screen. Having multiple items on a screen shortens the duration of the interview but negatively influences the respondent's evaluation of the questionnaire layout. Grouping effects are generally similar for different demographic groups, though there are some differences in magnitude and significance level.},
